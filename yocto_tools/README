A small and simple tool collection for Yocto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*** FIRSTLY ***
In the 'common' script, pl *ensure* you set these variables correctly:
 YOCTO_PFX=/opt/yocto/poky : set to the yocto workspace directory on your system
 BUILD_DIR=build_aarch32   : set to the yocto workspace 'build' dir on your system

(Above, it's shown as set; by default to a Qemu Aarch32 (ARM-32) demo build).

The files currently available are:

common                : contains common vars and a few utility functions
 
host_setup_4yocto     : helper script to setup an Ubuntu host system for Yocto

README                : this file

show_all_build_images : simple script that shows all possible build targets
                        for bitbake (eg. bitbake core-image-minimal)

qemuarm_demo_builddir : has the content of the demo Qemu Aarch32 Yocto build project,
                        primarily the content of the <build>/conf/ dir
						(the project is on the custom Yocto VM provided to participants)

yct_recipe_gen        : a simple yocto 'recipe generator' script; as of now, it's
                        in development and very simplistic; might nevertheless
			 prove a bit useful
			 (of course, Yocto provides the full-fledged recipetool util).

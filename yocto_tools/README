A small and simple tool collection for Yocto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIRST:
In the 'common' script, pl Ensure you set these variables correctly:
 YOCTO_PFX=/opt/yocto/poky : set to the yocto workspace directory on your system
 BUILD_DIR=build           : set to the yocto workspace 'build' dir on your system


The files curr available are:

common : contains common vars and a few utility functions
 
host_setup_4yocto : helper script to setup an Ubuntu host system for Yocto

README  : this file

show_all_build_images : simple script that shows all possible build targets
                        for bitbake
						(eg. bitbake core-image-minimal)

yct_recipe_gen  : a simple yocto 'recipe generator' script; as of now, it's
                  in development and very simplistic; might nevertheless
				  prove a bit useful
				  (Of course, Yocto provides the full-fledged recipetool util).

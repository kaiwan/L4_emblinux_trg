A small and simple tool collection for Yocto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We assume that most of these scripts will be run from within your Yocto
workspace; in effect, the TOPDIR or BUILDDIR, and that you've correctly sourced
the oe-init-build-env script.

The tools/helper scripts currently available are:

burn4rpi_sd.sh        : 'burn' script wrapper for the Raspberry Pi (media: uSD card in
                         regular laptop SDcard reader)
burn4rpi_usbsd.sh     : 'burn' script wrapper for the Raspberry Pi (media: USB card reader)

common                : contains common vars and a few utility functions
(It's useful setup_env() function displays the foll, for example:
<...>: current workspace/build config:
BUILDDIR = <...>/poky/build_qemuarm64
MACHINE  = qemuarm64
IMAGE    = core-image-base
TESTDATA_JSON file = <...>/poky/build_qemuarm64/tmp/deploy/images/qemuarm64/core-image-base-qemuarm64.testdata.json


disp_all_build_images : simple script that shows all possible build targets
                        for bitbake (eg. core-image-minimal)
 
host_setup_4yocto     : helper script to setup an Ubuntu host system for Yocto

lookup_recipe.sh      : queries and prints for each package in the current build,
                        {package-name          : recipe-that-generates-it}

query_toaster         : queries health of Toaster web-gui and displays some details if it's running

recipe_section_vals   : shows all possible values for the 'SECTION="xxx"' portion of a bitbake recipe

showvars              : given a recipe name, shows several bitbake variables and their current value
                        (for that recipe). Also attempts to list all tasks associated with the recipe
						(not stable)

showvars2             : better ver of previous; shows several bitbake variables and their current value.
                        Can pass multiple variable names as parameters (space separated); it will
						attempt to query and display their value(s)

README                : this file

wic_wrsdcard.sh       : (We're assuming the image is to be written to an (u)SD card mmcblk0)
                        It genertaes the WIC image(s) (auto-detecting the image type (eg. core-image-base)
						and the machine value; if sucessful, it attempts to write it out

yct_recipe_gen        : a simple yocto 'recipe generator' script; as of now, it's
                        in development and very simplistic; might nevertheless
                        prove a bit useful (of course, Yocto provides the full-fledged recipetool util).
